# Jest Test Explorer for Visual Studio Code

Run your Jest tests using the [Test Explorer UI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-test-explorer).

> Forked and adopted from [rtbenfield/vscode-jest-test-adapter](https://github.com/rtbenfield/vscode-jest-test-adapter) where it appeared abandoned.  The project had a lot of potential, so it was adopted here.

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/kavod-io/vscode-jest-test-adapter/_apis/build/status/kavod-io.vscode-jest-test-adapter?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/kavod-io/vscode-jest-test-adapter/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

## Getting Started
* Install the extension and restart VS Code
* Open a project with Jest tests
  * Currently limited to Jest being available from the `./node_modules/.bin/jest` path from the VS Code workspace directory. We are working to make this more flexible.
* Open the Test view
* Run / Debug your tests in the Test Explorer
